## CAD descriptions

## Data descriptions
### Microfluidic experiments
All the data were taken by Olympus IX81 microscope with a 10x objective every 10 minutes. Pixel-to-um conversion is 1 um = 1.55 pixel.
### Plate experiments
Colony collision experiments were recorded by Zeiss Axio Zoom microscope. Luria-Delbrück experiments were recorded by a digital camera.
## Codes desciptions
### Matlab codes
### Agent-based simulaitons

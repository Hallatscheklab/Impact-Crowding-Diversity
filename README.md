## Introduction
This repository contains codes, data, and CAD blueprints for the manuscript: Carl F. Schreck, Diana Fusco, Yuya Karita, Stephen Martis, Jona Kayser, Marie-Cécilia Duvernoy, Oskar Hallatschek, "Impact of crowding on the diversity of expanding populations", bioRxiv, doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/743534.

## CAD descriptions
CAD blueprints were drawn with QCAD. The leftmost two holes are for midium inlets, the middle hole is for a cell inlet, and the right hole is for a waste outlet.

## Data descriptions
### Microfluidic experiments
All the data were taken by Olympus IX81 microscope with a 10x objective every 10 minutes. Pixel-to-um conversion is 1 um = 1.55 pixel.
### Plate experiments
Colony collision experiments were recorded by Zeiss Axio Zoom microscope. Luria-Delbrück experiments were recorded by a digital camera.
## Codes desciptions
### Matlab codes
"Drift_Correct.m" is a code for correcting the drift of a microscope stage, used for data pre-processing. "Semi_manual_tracking.m" is a code for tracking the growth and displacement of color-switched cells.
### Agent-based simulaitons
